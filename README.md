# Virtual-Machine

This is a Virtual Matchine made in middle school during a Computer Architecture camp.
I made a assembler, dissassembler, and an emulator all from scratch.
I learned about:
- How computers store information and commands
- How computers proccess commands and information
- How computers execute commands.
